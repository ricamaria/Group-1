# Mental Health in Australia
### Exploratory Analysis of Data from the 2021 ABS Census

#### What can the 2021 ABS Census tell us about factors that may correlate with a high prevalence of mental health conditions?

This repository contains a project that explores some of the data from the 2021 ABS Census and what it might be able to tell us about mental health in Australia.

Our analysis looked at 4 main sections from the Census:  
* G20 Count of Selected Long-Term Health Conditions (*Mental Health only*)
* G29 Family Composition
* G36 Dwelling Structure
* G41 Dwelling Structure by Number of Bedrooms

The summary of our conclusions is presented in the powerpoint file.

The ABS data notebook demonstrates how we extracted and arranged our master dataset.

The other 3 notebooks in the main folder contain the analysis for three areas of data exploration:
* By dwelling type
* By number of bedrooms and by family composition
* By region

The Resources folder contains data extracts predominantly from the ABS website, with some additional geodata from AusPost.

The Output folder contains both dataset csvs and the plots generated from our analysis.
